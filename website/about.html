                        <p>
                            Speech Diary is a website built for helping those who experience a speech 
                            impediment. It provides several tools that enable a person to track their 
                            speech, identify areas of improvement or strength, and to share results to 
                            their support network.</p>
                        <p>
                            While Speech Diary can be used by anyone who wants to improve their speaking, 
                            it is recommended to be used while undertaking the Camperdown Program with a 
                            professional speech therapist. This website is also used for the maintenance of 
                            speech results after therapy. It will allow users to identify when their speech 
                            is worsening and to maintain good habits of practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Data driven insights and decision are important aspects of Speech Diary. This means 
                            that by engaging with the tools available a user can objectively see their progress 
                            and challenge any subjective self-perceptions that may get in the way.
                        </p>
